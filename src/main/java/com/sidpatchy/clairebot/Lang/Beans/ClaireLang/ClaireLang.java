/**
 * Hello future sufferers. I'm glad we're in this together :)
 * <p>
 * Here is the commit message that was written when this structure was devised:
 * <p>
 * &quot;I prefer the idea of this structure, I just don't like the implementation of this structure.
 * <p>
 * Also considered doing one giga-class (technical term :)), but that would've been much less readable than whatever in the fuck this is.
 * <p>
 * Probably would've been easier to understand the intent of though... I will need to write some really good javadoc if I stick with this.&quot;
 * <p>
 * IntelliJ is angry at me for using &quot;really good.&quot; Too bad!
