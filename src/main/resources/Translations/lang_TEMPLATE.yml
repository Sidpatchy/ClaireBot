# happily assist you in determining this.

# The above being said, you are more than welcome to update this value to match the
# language revision you are translating to.
#
# This number should be changed in accordance with the following:

# ClaireLang version numbers are incremented every time new parameter(s) are added. If the main language file (en-US)
# has its wording changed, a .1, .2, .3 decimal value will be added.

# yet translated.
