# Any notes that translators feel the need to express, written in the target language.
# At your option, you may leave this field blank if you feel that it is not needed. If updating the language file,

# If you are translating ClaireBot, you do not need to worry about understanding this, the project maintainer(s) will
# happily assist you in determining this.
#
# The above being said, you are more than welcome to update this value to match the
# language revision you are translating to.
#
# This number should be changed in accordance with the following:

# ClaireLang version numbers are incremented every time new parameter(s) are added. If the main language file (en-US)
# has its wording changed, a .1, .2, .3 decimal value will be added.
#
# ClaireLang version numbers are used by the bot to assist in determining whether parameters are missing or not
# yet translated.
