# happily assist you in determining this.
#
# The above being said, you are more than welcome to update this value to match the
# language revision you are translating to.
#
# This number should be changed in accordance with the following:

# has its wording changed, a .1, .2, .3 decimal value will be added.
#
# ClaireLang version numbers are used by the bot to assist in determining whether parameters are missing or not
# yet translated.
