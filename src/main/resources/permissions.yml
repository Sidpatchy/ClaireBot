# The purpose of this file is to grant Discord users access to
# ClaireBot's administrative commands.
#
# NOTE: Granting untrusted users permissions to ClaireBot's administrative
# feature set is quite frankly stupid and will only lead to issues.
# You have been warned!
#
# For a full list of permissions and a guide on how to use this file
