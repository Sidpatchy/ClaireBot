ClaireBot is a feature-packed Discord bot (being re-)written in Java/Kotlin.

The audio-streaming functionality will be removed in the near future, I no longer have interest in maintaining it. It has been buggy and thus disabled by default for quite some time anyways...

As of now, ClaireBot 3 alpha releases are being hosted on the main ClaireBot which you can invite using https://invite.clairebot.net/

ClaireBot 2 is still available and will slowly be shutting down as features are ported to ClaireBot 3, you can invite the legacy bot using https://legacy.clairebot.net/
